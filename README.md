# I made this website, getting the idea from rita mode website, but more unique.
# used templates from w3schools, such as:
# 1) image cards for products
# 2) pagination

# my brother MansourH1 built the automatic image slider (I debugged it)
# he helped me organise all categories (I debugged)

# I made many mistakes on the go, including a horrible folder/files organization, then I fixed it all, learning quality lessons from them.
# horrifying enough, my first time working on an actual server called plesk, messed up then my senior developer friend saved me ðŸ˜‚
